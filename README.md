1. [Classification Algorithm ](https://github.com/haiilingg/Machine-Learning-with-Python/blob/main/%20Classification%20of%20diabetic%20patients.ipynb)

#### Problem Statement
The data set comprises of 768 cases and the objective is to predict base on the measures to predict if the patient is diabetic or not. The data set contains the comparison of 8 medical analyst variables and one Target variable say 'outcome'. The â€˜outcomeâ€™ is the feature we are going to predict- â€˜0â€™ means no diabetes â€˜1â€™ means diabetes.

2. [Regression Algorithm](https://github.com/haiilingg/Machine-Learning-with-Python/blob/main/Regression%20of%20house%20prices.ipynb)
#### Problem Statement
As a junior data analyst in a real estate company, It is your job to predict the sales price for each house. For each Id in the test set, you must predict the value of the SalePrice variable. You project manager asked you to proceed with the dataset provided. In this case study, you need to develop an ML model that predicts the house price based on the features provided in the dataset.

3. [Clustering Algorithm](https://github.com/haiilingg/Machine-Learning-with-Python/blob/main/Clustering%20of%20Retail%20Customers.ipynb)
#### Problem Statement
As a junior data analyst intern in a firm. For one of the clients XYZ marketings, your manager asked you to do a customer segmentation ML model that can, later on, be developed to give recommendations like saving plans, loans, wealth management, etc. on target customer groups of XYZ Marketings. For this, you have been provided with a dataset summarising the usage behavior of active credit card holders during the last 6 months in XYZ Marketings.

4. [Time Series Prediction](https://github.com/haiilingg/Machine-Learning-with-Python/blob/main/Time%20Series%20Prediction%20of%20Sales%20Volume.ipynb)
#### Problem Statement
As a junior data analyst intern in a firm. For one of the client XYZ marketings, your manager asked you to use time-series forecasting to forecast store sales on data from CorporaciÃ³n Favorita, a large Ecuadorian-based grocery retailer. Here, you'll build a model that more accurately predicts the unit sales for thousands of items sold at different Favorita stores. Your manager believes that it will help you practice your machine-learning skills with an approachable training dataset of dates, store, and item information, promotions, and unit sales.Dataset from [HERE](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/store-sales-time-series-forecasting/data)
